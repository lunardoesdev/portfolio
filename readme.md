  including cross-compilation

- rust
- nim
- zig
- lua
- yuescript
- html/css/js
- taskfile (taskfile.dev)
- github ci including automatic release generation/upload
- php (2 years of commercial experience)
- go
- python (I've used pyinstaller inside wine inside docker!)
- bash
- docker/podman
- minimalistic css frameworks
  (ones that work without even giving classes to your html tags)
- tailwind css
- vite js/ts
- emscripten
- jujutsu version control (git compatible)

# Examples of my work:

## color palette generator:
https://lunardoesdev.github.io/colorpalette

refresh to generate, click to copy color code

source: https://github.com/lunardoesdev/colorpalette

## github ci build of libi2pd
https://github.com/lunardoesdev/libi2pd-builds

I've tried to build libi2pd (not i2pd) with
c headers to work with.

## memory card matching game
https://lunardoesdev.github.io/matchmem/site/

minimalistic but shows that I can work with javascript,
typescript, animations, and you can play it of course

## small cute portfolio site
https://lunardoesdev.github.io/portfolio

Small portfolio site, written with minimalism
in mind.

## loading and showing tilemap in javascript/kaplay:
https://lunardoesdev.github.io/infinite-world-generator/

## rust bindings to libi2pd
https://github.com/lunardoesdev/i2pd-rust

it will download a lot of deps automatically and
build libi2pd from source statically to be used
from rust using "safe" api wrapper crate.
