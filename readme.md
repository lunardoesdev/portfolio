## Commercial Experience

**PHP Developer (legacy, NDA/closed-source) — ~1.5 years (approx. 2015–2016)**
- Developed and maintained PHP backend features for internal/client web apps
- Worked with SQL databases (CRUD, indexing basics, query tuning)
- Implemented caching where appropriate and reduced repeated DB load
- Fixed bugs, shipped changes under deadlines

After early commercial PHP experience, continued development through independent projects and open-source (see featured projects); currently focusing on Python/Node.js and actively interviewing.
